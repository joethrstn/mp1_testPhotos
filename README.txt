mp1_testPhotos README
=============================================

Welcome to the mp1 testPhotos repository. The purpose of this repo is for multiple different CPEN 221 teams to share images that their methods output. 
By observing different photos and how they vary it is my hope that all groups will be able to refine their methods so that all outputs match and thus our 
methods are all correct.

=============================================

ABSOLUTELY NO PUSING CODE. ONLY PUSH IMAGES. THIS REPO IS NOT FOR SHARING CODE.

=============================================

Please take great care to name your files and log your comparisons correctly so that everyone benefits from everyone else's tests.
Detailed information about naming conventions and file structure are below for your reference.

=============================================

File Structure:

	Top level:
		Each folder contains files for a different test. If you have a processed photo from that method, upload it to that folder.

	Inside each test folder:
		There is a log file titled "testName_Results.txt" to document tests that you run. Each log has a sample entry at the top to follow. 
		Everytime you run a test please log it so everyone gets the benefit of your test.

==============================================

Naming Conventions:

Every single image you upload must follow this format:

originalFileName_methodRun_nameOfUploader_revisionNum.jpg

	originalFileName: Whatever name the original file has in the resources folder
	testRun: The name of the method you applied to the photos
	nameOfUploader: The first name of whoever uploaded the image
	revisionNum: if you upload multiple processed images use this number to show which revision
	.jpg: ALL PHOTOS MUST BE JPG SO THEY CAN BE COMPARED TO EACHOTHER

Example:
